## What is this site?

This site is a house for my thoughts. a

What started off as a basic one-page portfolio listing my projects and information turned into 6 sleepless days worth of blog goodness complete with:

* a per-post markdown parser through Jekyll,
* functional, sorted archive with a tag cloud,
* links page for interesting sites,
* responsive search function

And all of these on a **completely responsive** interface.

This series of articles will be methods of keeping files as small and fast as possible to make sure your site loads with no bumps, no bruises, no hitches, no scratches (or at least minimal bumps, bruises, hitches, and scratches).
