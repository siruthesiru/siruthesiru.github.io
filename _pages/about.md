I do not actually have sclera white skin so the little picture above this introduction may be mislead but I definitely
am **Sirutonin**! Hello!

Having lots of thoughts and stories with not a lot of people to share with, I decided to create this blog
and will try to add to it as much as possible.

Hope you have fun!
