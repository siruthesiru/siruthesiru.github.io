Back in 2016, I had accidentally destroyed my laptop's Windows 7 installation by downloading and installing a malware-ridden copy
of the digital piano software Synthesia. <!--more-->

Being a teenager with zero income in a small town on a small island miles away from the nearest computer repair shop, I
figured that I could just solve the problem myself.

So one day during computer class, I made sure to finish my seatwork as fast as possible so I had time to look up ways to 
get my laptop to be usable.

As it turns out **WINDOWS IS REALLY EXPENSIVE!** And since I had just been handed the bad end of the piracy stick through that
Synthesia fiasco, pirating a copy was *100%* off the table.

Defeated, I had no choice but to look up *free Windows alternative* and there it was.

It was the first time I've ever seen an operating system besides Windows 7 and below.
