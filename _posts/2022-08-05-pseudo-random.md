# Pseudo Random in Dota 2

In video games, when a character has a 10% chance to trigger an effect during a certain action, then you would expect that
event to occur at least once in 10 attempts. However... <!--more-->with true random number generation, that isn't quite how it works.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
    printf("Hello world.");
}
```
