![Oracle from Dota 2](/img/in-post/2022/oracle.png)

In video games, when a character has a 10% chance to trigger an effect during a certain action, then you would expect that
event to occur at least once in 10 attempts. However with true random number generation, that isn't quite how it works. <!--more-->

## Math

Inline math: $$ E = mc^2 $$

inline: $$f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \hat f(\xi)\,e^{2 \pi i \xi x} \,d\xi$$
display mode (centered):

$$f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \hat f(\xi)\,e^{2 \pi i \xi x} \,d\xi$$
