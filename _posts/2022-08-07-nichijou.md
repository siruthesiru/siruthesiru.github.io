Anime has somehow driven me away the past few years. Ever since graduating the 12th grade, I haven't finished a single series despite the medium being such a huge part of my gradeschool life. There may be many reasons for this to have happened but after a quick date with a cup of coffee and a notepad, I've pinpointed the most impactful culprit: the humor.

## Overused Tropes in Anime
Oh? What's that? The perverted pre-adult protagonist accidentally walked into one of his 473 love interests while she was in the middle of changing for the 625th time? Never gets old. Scratch that - it did.

I grew tired of writers falling back on simple tropes whenever the story either gets too heavy or too boring.
